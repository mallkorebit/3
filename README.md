# Nika Read Only

- Apex Legends external cheat for Linux.

## Introduction

- The goal of this project is to have a working Linux cheat that can run alongside Apex Legends on my i5-6600K 4c/4t Linux PC.
- This a modification of: [Pesci-Apu/Nika]().
- With an overlay taken from: [Gerosity/zap-client-Read-Only-]().
- The code remains simple and clean. You can read it out and understand how the overlay is added.
- Lines were commented out with a "**//_**" prefix or added with a "**//_add**" suffix. Also "**//_begin**" and "**//_end**" was used for large blocks.

### 1. Environment set up in Linux

- Install dependencies (<b>Arch</b>):
``` shell
sudo pacman -Sy libudev0 cmake xorg-server git base-devel libx11 libxtst
```

or

- Install dependencies (<b>Debian</b>):
``` shell
sudo apt-get install -y libudev-dev
sudo apt install cmake xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev
sudo apt install -y libudev-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev git cmake g++ gcc libinput-dev libsoil-dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev
```

### 2. Build & Install GLFW

``` shell
su
chmod 700 /root
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
cd glfw
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

### 3.0 Updating

- If you are updating, run this command first: `sudo rm -fr /root/Nika-Read-Only-Spoof-Unspoof`

### 3.1 Build

``` shell
su
mv Nika-Read-Only-Spoof-Unspoof /root/Nika-Read-Only-Spoof-Unspoof
cd /root/Nika-Read-Only-Spoof-Unspoof
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cp main /root/main
cp nika.ini /root/nika.ini
chmod +x main.sh
cp main.sh /root/main.sh
cp www.txt /root/www.txt
chmod +x spoof.sh
cp spoof.sh /root/spoof.sh
chmod +x unspoof.sh
cp unspoof.sh /root/unspoof.sh
```

### 4. Spoof & Run

``` shell
su
cd /root
./spoof.sh
./main.sh
```

### 5. HWID unban

- My storage serial numbers were collected most likely from **dbus**. Widely adopted Linux **systemd** `init` as currently being distributed has the security profile of an internet **meme**.
- Disabling **udisksd** will prevent populating **dbus** with storage serials. Run `spoof.sh` then reboot.
- After reboot the following command will now fail as intended: `dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.UDisks2 --type=method_call --print-reply  /org/freedesktop/UDisks2 org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager.GetManagedObjects | grep by-id`
- Always run `spoof.sh` before you open the game.
- You can confirm that **udisksd** is disabled by finding it misplaced in /root with: `ls /root`

### 6. GNU MAC Changer

- Install (Arch): `sudo pacman -S macchanger`
- Install (Debian): `sudo apt install macchanger`
- Edit **spoof.sh** and modify it where needed: `sudo nano /root/spoof.sh`

### 7. CachyOS + KDE + NVIDIA proprietary driver

- You need to right-click Apex Legends in your taskbar and check: More >> Keep Below Others.
- Set to "**Borderless Window**" in-game, press ESC >> Settings >> Video >> Display Mode.
- Auto hide your taskbar, right-click it >> Enter Edit Mode >> Visibility: **Auto hide**.
